  <li>In order to lay the groundwork for future changes/improvements,
    and to make it easier to search for things that are not assigned,
    we have modified the <code>Real Name</code> of all bugzilla accounts
    that are default assignees as such:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>Assignee: freebsd-net (Nobody)</code>.<br>
    This is to make it more obvious that default assignees are assigned to
    <code>Nobody</code> and encourages self-assignment (to real people) to
    make resolution more consistent.</li>

  <li>To help support the 202007 Bug Squash, all of the PRs containing
    patches were audited so that:
    <ul>
      <li>Each attachment that has its <code>Patch</code> flag set has
        been verified to contain a patch.</li>
      <li>If an attachment filename ends in <code>.diff</code> or
        <code>.patch</code>, its <code>Patch</code> flag has been
        verified to be set.</li>
      <li>The remaining attachment filenames end in <code>.shar</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This officially obsoletes the use of the the <code>Keywords</code>
    field value of <code>patch</code>.  This value had to be added by hand
    and as a result was applied inconsistently.</li>
